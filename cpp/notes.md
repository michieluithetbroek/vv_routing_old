#  <#Title#>

- Give every node at least n outgoing arcs

## Programming
- Allocate vector for x values once in the Callback class instead of in lazy callback function
- Read more variables at once instead of one by one
- Only create variables for non-zero arcs. Maybe we can use a vector of all existing arcs in the model class.
- auto const start1 = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
